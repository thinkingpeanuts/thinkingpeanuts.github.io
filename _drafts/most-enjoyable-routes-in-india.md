Do statewise

These are the most enjoyable routes I've ridden my motorcycle on. This doesn't necessarily mean the routes with the best tarmac. These are roads where I enjoyed riding the most. I have chosen these based on the road quality, senic beauty and overall feel-good factor of the routes specifically for motorcyles. I love long winding roads with sweeping curves. I love to ride through country roads as the fields whiz pass me. Hills and mountains are obviously a ton of fun. These are the kinds or roads that I like. I do not enjoy riding on national highways. They're boring for the most part from a rider's perspective. State highways are good. They're usually lined with trees and fields and see less traffic than the national highways. And local roads connecting smaller towns through hills, forests and fields are the best. 

<i>Note: Road conditions are always changing. Also, based on the time of the year and weather, the surroundings might be different as well. So if you plan to take any of the listed routes, check with Google maps and ask the locals about road conditions.</i>

## 1. Mahad - Dapoli

Route: Mahad - Revtale - Latvan - Palgadh - Dapoli<br>
Distance: 58 kms<br>
Rode on: 2nd October 2023

I rode through this route during my solo trip through the konkan. This 50 or so km stretch is a small narrow road, barely wider than a single lane road. There was barely any traffic on this route. It goes up and down through some hills, with a lot of twists and turns. There are lush green meadows all around and he road qulaity was fantastic as well.
