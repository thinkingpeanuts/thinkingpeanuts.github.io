title: Motorcycle Riding Gear Explained
---
This article is a result of my own research while getting into the world of motorcycles. Riding gear is an altogether different breed of clothing that takes some time to understand. I will elaborate on the more intricate details of riding gear and safety standards. I suggest you read this article in its entirety to help you make an informed choice on what safety gear to buy.

Consider this article to be an introduction to riding gear. It's a massive rabbit hole and there are more things to consider when choosing new motorcycle gear. This article is a good primer but I still suggest you do your own research and get gear specific to your needs.

## Why you need riding gear?

Anyone can make mistakes no matter how experienced you are. Animals can come in from anywhere, anytime. There are a lot of bad riders on the roads. You could be the most cautious ride on the road but someone else might be driving rash and fast and bump into you. There could be potholes on the road. Water might cause a loss of friction. There are many more of such dangerous scenarios. So remember ATGATT - all the gear, all the time. 

## Try before you buy

A proper fit is very important for riding gear. It needs to be snug without being too tight or too loose. So always try to go to a store and try stuff out before you buy. Take a helmet for example. You need to wear it for a little bit and check that you don't experience any pressure points. Similarly with gloves, you want a good snug fit but know that some gloves expand a little as you wear them regularly. 

## Urban, Touring or Off-Road

There are broadly three categories of riding gear based their usage scenarios. Urban gear is for city use and is usually lighter and more casual in look. Touring gear is usually more comprehensive with some extra touring specific features. Similarly off-road gear has some purpose built features. It's not that one type of gear won't work for another activity but it might not be as comfortable.

This article is more oriented towards urban/touring gear since that is what I am more familiar with.

Here's a basic rundown of all the gear you need.

### 1. Helmet

A helmet is the most important piece of riding gear since it protects what's most important - your head. So you want a full face helmet. 35% of all head impacts in motorcycles accidents are to the chin/jaw area<sup><a href="#references">[1]</a></sup>. So half face helmets are not as safe.

Here are a few common helmet safety certifications - ISI, DOT and ECE. There are more but for the sake of simplicity I will just cover these.

ISI - Indian Standards Institute<br>
DOT - Department of Transportation (USA)<br>
ECE - Economic Commission of Europe<br>
FIM - Federation Internationale de Motocyclisme (Used in Moto GP)<br>

For all intents and purposes ISI and DOT certifications are useless. They are self certifications as in manufacturers need to ensure their helmets pass the certification by themselves, meaning no third party tests. I don't know how much I would trust manufacturers to follow up on it. FIM is the safest. It is the only one allowed in Moto GP. However, it is the most expensive and we don't have a lot of options for FIM helmets in India. ECE is the certification you want. The latest one is ECE 22.06. It is very close to FIM, a lot cheaper but still pretty expensive when compared to ISI helmets. Since in India you need the ISI certification for a helmet, what you want is a helmet that is ECE 22.06 and ISI certified. For locking mechanisms, double D rings are safer than quick release buckles<sup><a href="#references">[2]</a></sup>. And if you plan to take you bike to the track, only D ring helmets are allowed.

Some other features to look for in a helmet are internal sun visors and pinlock compatibility. An internal sun visor is a really practical and useful feature especially in the sunny Indian weather. It eliminates the use of sun glasses. One downside is that in order to fit the sun visor, the manufacturer might have to compromise on the foam at the front of the helmet. I don't have any data about how much of a difference that makes for safety but having used a sun visor, I can say it's a really useful feature to have.

A pinlock is a thin film that attaches to the inside of the primary visor. It creates an air tight chamber that doesn't let the visor fog up which is really useful in some conditions. Some helmets come with a pinlock film pre-installed and you can buy it separately for some other helmets. But not all visors support pinlock, so be on the look out for pinock compatibility when choosing a helmet. There are multiple pinlock variations and each visor supports different pinlock models.

One more thing you can look for is availability of different visors for your helmet. A clear visor is the most common out there but you can also get them smoked or mirrored. Each of them have their own pros and cons so do your own research and get what you need. A default clear visor is a good one to have since if works during the day or the night unlike smoked/mirrored visor which have visibility issues in the dark. Helmets these days have quick swap mechanisms for visors so you can also carry multiple with you. In my opinion, a clear primary visor with an internal sun visor give you the best of both worlds.

Always check for availability of spares for your specific helmet like visors, pinlock and internal liners.

Some brands that sell ECE 22.06 certified helmets - MT, Axor, SMK and Royal Enfield.

### 2. Jacket

You want a jacket with CE level 2 protectors for shoulders, elbows, back and chest. A mesh intake and outlet is really important in India's hot weather. A jacket to pants connection zipper is nice to have since you can connect you jacket to you pants which will prevent it from sliding up in case of an accident.

### 3. Gloves

We always use our hands to break the fall. Get CE certified gloves with knuckle protection and sliders for scaphoid/palm protection. A pinky bridge is nice to have.

4. Pants

Get pants with CE level 2 protectors for knees and hips. Some pants also have a tail bone protector. Again, a jacket connection zipper is nice to have. Make sure they're compatible with each other. Some mesh for airflow is desirable. If you plan on going for tours I'd suggest full riding pants with abrasion resistance and armour. If you want them for daily use, you could get riding denims with protectors. There are also denims these days with kevlar weaved into them for more abrasion resistance.

5. Boots

Human feet are really complicated and a foot injury could be really hard to heal from. Get CE certified riding boots with toe, heel, ankle(both sides) and shin protectors. Full length riding boots could be cumbersome for daily use. You could get casual riding riding boots with ankle, toe and heel protectors.

A little more about CE certification for boots. Certification to EN 13634: 2017 is the one you want as it is the specific standard is for "Protective footwear for motorcycle riders". A lot of other boots, for example the Raida Explorer Boots, are CE Certified to EN ISO 20345 which is a standard for safety footwear for general purpose which is not exactly what we want for motorcycle boots. There are 4 components to this EN 13634: 2017 - height of upper, abrasion resistance, impact cut resistance and transverse rigidity. There are 2 levels of certifications for each component so when a shoe is labelled as 2 2 2 2, it means that it's certified to level 2 in all 4 components. There are also some other optional tests like WR(Water Resistance) which could be mentioned under the rating label.

Here is a sample rating label from my <a href = "{% post_url 2024-04-08-raida-trailcraft-motorcycle-boots-review %}">Raida TrailCraft Motorcycle Boots.</a>

Royal Enfield makes some casual riding boots that can pass off as normal boots but most of them are not CE certified. They also have a line of shoes in collaboration with TCX which are CE certified. Clan is another company that sells CE riding shoes for daily wear. Some other brands to look into are Raida and Viaterra.

Protective Garments

There are 2 elements to protection in garments - 

Abrasion resistance - A garment can be made of either textile or leather. Textile is cheaper but leather has more abrasion resistance. Purpose made modern textiles have good abrasion resistance as well. What's important in hot climates like India is ventilation. Jackets made entirely of leather or textile will cook you in India's heat. They should ideally have mesh intakes and outlets for good airflow.

Impact protection - All riding gear has armour/protectors for impact protection. Always look for protectors with CE certification. It's a European safety standard. There are 2 levels of CE armour - level 1 and level 2. CE level 2 is safer and can withstand more impact.

ATGATT

entire garment be aa rated or just protectors? 
list difference and what to choose

give it some time to get used to it. but helmet only after trying, all gear if possible

write about fit of helmet and gloves and boots
pinlock
sunvisor
do more research, wathc videos read articles, check reviews
internal sun visor lessens safety
do your own research about everything, let this serrve as a startin gpoint or a basic explainer. there is more to safety and there are exceptions to the thigns ai metnioned so do you own reearch, cross check and verify stuff. I fyou find conflicting information please let me know and I will update this article if necessary.

rain specific gear
winter specific gear
waterproof options, over hoes ovbe gloves etc
