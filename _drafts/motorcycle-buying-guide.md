title: How to choose the right motorcycle for you
---
This is how I choose a new motorcycle. This guide will help you pick the right motorcycle for you, or at least help you narrow down your choices. This might not work for everyone, but I think this is a good starting point.

Let me start by saying this - no one can make this choice but you, people can help, but the final decision has be yours.

What's your purpose?

I don't mean your purpose in life but rather with your motorcycle (maybe they both align?). What do you need out of your motorcycle? Do you just want to commute to your college and back? Do you want to go for long tours? Do you want to take it off-road and hit the trails? Do you want to take it to the track? Do you plan to ride solo or with a pillion? Answer these questions and you'll have an idea of the type of bike you want. Here's some of the types of bikes you can get.

Retro Classic / Roadster

These are your classic old school bikes with retro styling.
Examples - Royal Enfield Classic 350, Honda CB350, TVS Ronin.

Adventure

These bikes, as the name suggests, are made for adventure. They have better suspension setups with longer travel, large fuel tanks and comfy seats.
Examples - Royal Enfield Himalayan, KTM Adventure 390.

Commuter

Commuter bikes are simple 100cc-150cc bikes that are made for everyday commuting. They have small engines which helps them get great mileage.
Examples - Honda Shine 100, Hero Splendor

Cruiser

These are similar to classic roadsters but h

Scooter
Naked

A spectrum of colours

So now that you have chosen what bike you want, it's time to choose a colour. I believe this is a very personal choice. I see posts about people asking what colour looks best in a certain model and it almost never makes sense to me. If you're buying a bike, YOU have to look at it everyday, nobody else. So choose what you want. The questions make sense sometimes, like when it's about a certain type of finish, like how hard is chrome to maintain rather than say matte finish. But then again, if you're gonna buy a bike and look at it everyday, wouldn't you rather get something that you really love than something that you just kinda like? I would.   

What trim to select

Motorcycles usually have a few different trims on sale with a couple of differences like some extra features, different wheels or different colours. Take the Honda CB350RS for example. There are 4 trims on sale as of 2024: DLX, DLX PRO, DLX PRO DUAL TONE and HUE edition. The only major difference other than the colours is the presence of bluetooth connectivity on all models other than the DLX. Now, as good as bluetooth sounds, since the CB350RS does not have an an lcd display, bluetooth is only usable with headsets which I don't think is that useful. But for some other bikes, they might have spoked wheels in the base variants and alloys in the higher trims. This is my opinion is useful option since alloy wheels equal tubeless tyres which makes punctures easier to fix. Since some manufacturers don't offer all colours in all trims, sometimes you might have to make a compromise on a colour you want or some features you need. Some common features that are different among trims are colours, spoke/alloy wheels, lcd display, bluetooth, adjustable suspension and more. 

Spokes vs Alloys

Choosing spokes vs alloys is an important decision. Spoked wheels usually come with tubed tyres, that means fixing punctures will be a lot more difficult. You'll have to take the tyre off, fix the tube or replace it and remount it. Fixing punctures on tubed tyres isn't the end of the world but it is a lot less convenient and a lot more time consuming. Alloys on the other hands usually come with tubeless tyres which means you can carry a small kit and fix punctures from the outside in like 5 minutes. Another benefit of tubeless tyres is that in case of a puncture, air usually seeps out slower than a puncture in a tubed tyre. 

A reason for choosing spoked wheels is if you plan to off road or hit the trails. Since spoked wheels aren't as stiff, you have some wiggle room whereas alloys could crack if you jump your bike. This is an oversimplification as there are debates online that newer alloys are just as durable as spoked wheels for off roading. I do not particularly off road or hit the trails so my knowledge about this is limited. I wil leave you to do your own research on this.

There are exceptions to this. Some higher end adventure bikes have spoked wheels and tubeless tyres giving you the best of both worlds. Royal Enfield recently came out with tubeless spoked wheels for the Himalayan 450 as well. So check what options are on offer for the bike you want and do your own research.

youll have to compromise on something, you wont get everything yo uneed in one bike - you can but its dfifficult

yo uwill get a miillion suggestuoins online and offiline and by all head them out and try all th ebike syou wnat but at the end of the day listen to yourself. you need to ride you bike, yo uneed to look at it everyday, listen to youer heart


specs dont matter
top speed doesnt matter

rent if possible

If you're wearing a proper snug fitting helmet like you should, then the exhaust note isn't that audible to the rider anyway. Try it while taking a test ride.

pdi list

how yo ufeel riding a bike >> how you look - people say i am too tall or too slim etc, if its comfortable thats important
