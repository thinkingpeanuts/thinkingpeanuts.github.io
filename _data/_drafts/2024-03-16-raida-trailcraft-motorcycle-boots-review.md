After an extensive search for full size touring boots, I bought a pair of Raida TrailCraft Motorcycle Boots. Since I was going to use them exclusively for touring I wanted zero compromises on safety so a CE certification was a must. I also wanted them to be waterproof. I didn't find a lot of of great options in my budget and narrowed my choices down to the Raida TrailCraft Boots and Tarmac Adventure Pro Boots. The Raidas are better built, more rigid, have better buckles and certified to a slightly higher level of CE certification. The advantage of the Tarmacs are that they are listed as water resistant while the Raidas are not(more on this later). They are also a little cheaper but spare part availability was non existent for the Tarmacs and a dealer in Bangalore told me it's gonna get more difficult as India has imposed new import restrictions.

Holding them for the first time, the boots seem really well made. They have good grip and are sturdy. They have shin, ankle, toe, heel and calf protection. They are CE Certified to EN 13634: 2017 (LEVEL 2) which is really important as this specific standard is for "Protective footwear for motorcycle riders". A lot of other boots for example the Raida Explorer Boots are CE Certified to EN ISO 20345 which is a standard for safety footwear for general purpose which is not really what we want for motorcycle boots. There are 4 components to this EN 13634: 2017 - height of upper, abrasion resistance, impact cut resistance and transverse rigidity. The Raida TrailCraft Boots are rated Level 2 in all four components.

The boots are a bit heavy and rigid. You do get used to them eventually though. They have a soft padding inside and are comfortable. At first they will feel too awkward to change gears in. Moving your toes up and down takes some practice and if you place your foot incorrectly, you could activate the rear brake. All of this takes some getting used to. It gets much easier once you ride a few hundred kilometers in them. They have decent walkability as well.

There is no mention of them being waterproof or even water resistant on the website. I emailed Raida about this and they say the boots do have a membrane but it loses effectiveness overtime so they don't advertise it. I was okay to compromise on this as I did not find other good waterproof boots in this range. Some do offer water-resistance but were lacking in other aspects. I do not plan riding a lot in the rain anyway and I can use some waterproof socks and boots covers if needed.

They are made of some sort of synthetic material which seems sturdy. They have stretch panels that help with walkability. They are secured using 4 buckles which ar replaceable and Raida sells them separately as well which is great. They're designed to be offroad boots but I have used them for touring and they seem to work great. I'd say these are a great buy for the price. No other boots in this range offer such great features.

Note: Raida does offer exchange on these boots if you need a different size but you have to send the boots back to them by courier on your own dime. However, they will ship the replacement boots to you for free.
