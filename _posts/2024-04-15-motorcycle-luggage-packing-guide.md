Here is how I pack for a motorcycle tour. This is a superset of things I carry with me. I pick and choose things from these based on the destination, duration and the time of the year. I keep a track of what items I pack in what bag and keep that list on my phone so I can get to things quicker. There is a linked spreadsheet which you can use to keep track of things. I've tried to make this list as exhaustive as possible. You might not need all of these so you can pick and choose what you want.

## How to use this Packing Guide

I have linked a custom spreadsheet that I use to help me pack. It has a list of items commonly carried on motorcycle tours and a section where you can add items which are not already included.  To use this sheet, you'll need Libre Office Calc which is an open source alternative to Microsoft Excel. When you open the file, you'll get a pop up asking if you want to enable macros. This sheet uses some custom macros to help you manage and track you belongings. Here's how to use it.

Prerequisites: <a href = "https://www.libreoffice.org/download/download-libreoffice/">Libre Office Calc</a>

1. Download the sheet by clicking <a href = "{{ site.url }}/downloads/Packing Guide.ods">HERE.</a>
2. Open the sheet. You'll see a pop up asking you to "Enable Macros". If you don't enable Macros, some functions will not work.
3. You can list down up to 5 names bags in cells A8 to A12. Each bag is represented by a different colour.

4. There are 4 columns for each item. 
    1. First column has the item name. 
    2. The second column changes background based on which bag the item is stored in. By default the cells are black which means you have not packed the item yet. 
    3. Clicking on a cell in this column presents a down arrow, clicking on which gives you a dropdown with a list of your bags. As you pack an item, pick the bag in which you place the it and the previous cell will automatically change colour based on the bag colour listed in Cells B8 to B12. This way you can make sure you don't miss anything essential.
    4. The 4th column is a section for "Notes". You can use this to list where in the bag you have stored the item.
    
    Here is a sample of the sheet partially filled in.

5. Clicking on the "Clear All" button will clear all the entries and reset the sheet.
6. I have added a list of items that are usually carried on motorcycle trips. There is also a section called "EXTRAS" where you can add other items that you may want to add to the list.

You can export this sheet as a pdf or click a picture on your phone so you can quickly look up where specific items are.

## Bathroom Kit

Double wrap all liquids in polythene bags to be safe in case anything leaks.

* Brush
* Toothpaste
* Tongue cleaner
* Soap/Body wash
* Shampoo
* Conditioner
* Face Wash

## High Altitude Tours

For high altitude tours like Ladakh, you might want to carry some specialised equipment. While you might not need them, these items are good to have.
* Medicine for AMS(Acute Mountain Sickness)
* Portable Oxygen Can
* Pulse Oximeter

## Extras

* RE x TCX WP Cabo Shoes
    * If I plan on staying overnight at some spots and need something to ride around town in, then I use these. These are much closer to normal shoes so I can walk easier in them and explore. 
* Viaterra Austin Riding Jeans
    * Again, these are much closer to normal jeans so I use these when riding in and around towns where I would need to walk a lot.

## Notes

* I especially like tail bags because they can also act as a back rest. I've toured for around 8000kms on my bike and I've never experienced any back pain on any of my rides. Partial credit goes to my tail bag.
* You might not be allowed to carry some of these items in a flight like pepper spray so plan accordingly.
