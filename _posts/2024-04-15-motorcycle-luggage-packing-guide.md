Here is how I pack for a motorcycle tour. This is a superset of things I carry with me. I pick and choose things from these based on the destination, duration and the time of the year. I keep a track of what items I pack in what bag and keep that list on my phone so I can get to things quicker. There is a linked spreadsheet which you can use to keep track of things. I've tried to make this list as exhaustive as possible. You might not need all of these so you can pick and choose what you want.

## Extras


* RE x TCX WP Cabo Shoes
    * If I plan on staying overnight at some spots and need something to ride around town in, then I use these. These are much closer to normal shoes so I can walk easier in them and explore. 
* Viaterra Austin Riding Jeans
    * Again, these are much closer to normal jeans so I use these when riding in and around towns where I would need to walk a lot.


## Notes

* I especially like tail bags because they can also act as a back rest. I've toured for around 8000kms on my bike and I've never experienced any back pain on any of my rides. Partial credit goes to my tail bag.
